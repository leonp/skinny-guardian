# Skinny Guardian

[Skinny Guardian](https://www.skinnyguardian.xyz) displays a simple list of the 30 most recently published Guardian articles. Article layouts are very simple for easy reading across screen widths. No javascript, static HTML, minimal CSS and no database = ⚡️ fast.

## Why?

A simple list of links is easy to scan. The Guardian has a great website, but Skinny Guardian makes for even faster reading, especially when you're serving nearly neat, static HTML. Perhaps good if you're using a phone on a commute with a patchy connection. Or if you just want to scan a range of articles for something to read.

## About

Built on static site generator [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com), Skinny Guardian serves static HTML. There's no database.

Uses [Tachyons CSS](http://tachyons.io), a lightweight, functional CSS 'framework' that weighs in at 14k gzipped. There's no javascript at all.

Hosted on Netlify for free CDN and SSL. Netlify works with Zapier to automatically build the site once an hour (that's how you get around having no database).

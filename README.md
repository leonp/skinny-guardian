# Skinny Guardian

[Skinny Guardian](https://www.skinnyguardian.xyz) displays a simple list of the 30 most recently published Guardian articles. Article layout is minimally styled for easy reading across screen widths. No javascript, static HTML and minimal CSS = ⚡️ fast.

## Why?

A simple list of links is easy to scan. The Guardian has a great website, but this makes for even faster reading, especially when you're serving nearly neat, static HTML. Perhaps good if you're using a phone on a commute. Or if you just want to scan a range of articles for something to read.

## About

Built on static site generator [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com), Skinny Guardian serves static HTML. There's no database. This makes it render very quickly, good if you're on a shonky mobile connection.

It's built on [Tachyons CSS](http://tachyons.io), a lightweight, functional CSS 'framework' that weighs in at 14k gzipped. There's no javascript at all.

Hosted on Netlify for free CDN and SSL. Netlify works with Zapier to automatically build the site once an hour (that's how you get around having no database).
